CDE/MOTIF LIKE THEME FOR GTK2/3 AND XFWM4

(Jos van Riswick/gpl3/josvanr@gmail.com)

VER 1.2


Please copy the CDEtheme directory to ~/.themes/CDEtheme


For the theme to take effect, go into Xfce Settings/Appearance and pick
CDEtheme to make the colors apply to all running apps. Similar in other desktop
envs.

For the xfwm4 theme to apply, go into Xfce Settings/Window Manager/Theme and choose
CDEtheme (for cde style window decorations)

Default color scheme is 'Broica' but you can also switch to any other CDE
colorscheme in the CDEtheme/palettes directory, by using the MotifColors.py
script. For each palette, in CDE you could choose between 4 or 8 colors, so do
one of these:

MotifColors.py palettes/Broica.dp 8
MotifColors.py palettes/Broica.dp 4

to generate all new files. For this to take effect, you need to switch to another 
scheme, and then switch back to CDEtheme again. 

Script now also generates a new theme directory eg for

./MotifColors palettes/Charcoal.dp 8

it makes a new theme 'CDEtheme-Charcoal-8-colors. So you can also click
on that.



REQUIREMENTS

For this script to work you need to install the pyqt4 modules. Eg on 
ubuntu something like:

sudo apt install python-qt4 

and of course you need python.
