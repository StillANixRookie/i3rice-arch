# 13

- types of architecture
	- hierarchical
	- heterarchical
- benefits of each type of architecture
- hybrid architecture
	- combines benefits of both of the other two
	- why it is would be good for a blended wing AUV
- \textbf{Ilias can talk about different robotics software}

# 15

- used as preliminary design of our control system

# 14

- describe how we figured out these operations (primarily from autosub)
- Front seat - control, comms, maneuvers
- Back seat - points of interest, payload, some sensors, high level command and analysis
- some information on difficulties of analysing control system of a blended wing AUV eg. have to figure out general equations of motion, taking into account hydrodynamic control derivatives
